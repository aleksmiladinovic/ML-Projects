# Car Price Estimator

In this project, we use the dataset from Kaggle platform (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asinow/car-price-dataset)) to build a model used for predicting car prices.  
The model that is used is **linear regression** model.

The emphasis of this project is *data visualization* and *interpretability* of results.
