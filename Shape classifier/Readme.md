Shape classifier contains an algorithm that classifies a shape of a given image using a convolutive neural network. The input consists of images, each one containing a picture of a shape most similar to one of the three basic shapes: rectangle, circle (or ellipse) and a triangle. This data is stored in multiple files: the images are tored in files 'data[number].aca', while the corresponding shapes are stored in files 'data description[number].aca'. The data files are stored with the number of pictures followed by their size, after which the images are stored as arrays.
